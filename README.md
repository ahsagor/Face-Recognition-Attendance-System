# Face Recognition Attendance System
 Attendance is prime important for both the teacher and student of an educational organization. So it is very important to keep record of the attendance. The problem arises when we think about the traditional process of taking attendance in class room. Calling name or roll number of the student for attendance is not only a problem of time consumption but also it needs energy. So an automatic attendance system can solve all above problems.   This project introduces an involuntary attendance marking system, devoid of any kind of interference with the normal teaching procedure. The system can be also implemented during exam sessions or in other teaching activities where attendance is highly essential. This system eliminates classical student identification such as calling name of the student, or checking respective identification cards of the student, which can not only interfere with the ongoing teaching process, but also can be stressful for students during examination sessions.  In addition, the students have to register in the database to be recognized. The enrolment can be done on the spot through the user-friendly interface.
